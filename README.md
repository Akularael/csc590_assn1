Implementation of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography algorithms for MSU CSC 590-002

Zach- put your actual use-case in encryption_test.py; just import your file and you should be able to make a quick class similar to mine to run your code through.

I think the only other thing that we may want to do is create a main() function that automatically runs through all of the code, but it should be unnecessary.
